# ðŸ“¦ Start CLI  

**Start CLI (`start-cli`)** is the official command-line tool for **StartOS** - a sovereignty-first operating system empowering anyone to run and host their own services independently.

The CLI is **essential** for:  
- building and packaging services into the **`.s9pk`** (StartOS Service Package) format,  
- remotely managing a StartOS node (listing services, installing, updating, backups, monitoring),  
- integrating StartOS with CI/CD pipelines and developer tooling.  

This repository provides **prebuilt `start-cli` binaries** for:  
- macOS (Intel x86_64 & Apple Silicon ARM64),  
- Linux (Intel x86_64 & ARM64).  

Official StartOS source code is here: [start9labs/start-os](https://github.com/start9labs/start-os).

## ðŸ”„ Release Workflow

Binaries are built and published automatically using **GitHub Actions** workflow:  

- Triggered on each new **tag** pushed (`vX.Y.Z`),  
- Builds for all supported platforms,  
- Generates SHA256 checksums for integrity verification,  
- Publishes a GitHub Release with `.tar.gz` archives ready for download.
